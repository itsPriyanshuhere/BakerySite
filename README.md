# BakerySite

Thanks to @Nimish-Dureja-10 for his equal contribution throughout the project.

Before running the project you need to install node on your system.
This would load the package.json and package-lock.json file in your system.
For running this project you need to require node libraries:-
express , body-parser , request , https 
You can import these libraries by writing command on cmd or terminal
command:- npm i express
npm i body-parser
npm i request
npm i https

You will have an error when running the project, go to the mail chimp documentation and request for api key and make the same update in the app.js file.
